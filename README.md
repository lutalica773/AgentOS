AgentOS

AgentOS is an AI-native operating system where autonomous agents replace traditional applications.

Instead of launching apps, users express intent — and AgentOS dynamically creates, deploys, and coordinates intelligent agents to execute tasks.

Core Idea

Traditional OS:
User → App → Action

AgentOS:
User → Intent → Prime Agent → Agent Swarm → Action

---

Architecture

🧠 Prime Agent

Central cognitive layer that understands user intent, learns behavior, and orchestrates all agents.

🧬 Personality Engine

Continuously builds a persistent user model based on interaction patterns.

⚡ Autonomous Agent Creation

AgentOS generates new agents automatically when recurring needs are detected.

🔄 Self-Improvement Loop

The system adapts itself using behavioral feedback and usage learning.

🧩 Agent Runtime

Dynamically loads and executes agents as modular intelligence units.

---

Vision

AgentOS explores a future where:

- applications disappear
- operating systems become intelligent
- computers adapt to humans instead of the opposite

---

Status

Prototype — active development.

Why AgentOS?

Current AI systems assist users.

AgentOS aims to become the system itself.
